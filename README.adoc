There are 2 parts to get the project workspaces up and running for you to see. First, the Shadow CLJS server, and second, 
the CLJS repl. Setup for each:


```Shell
npm install


# 1.  (there are several ways to run this, but I find this easiest)
npx shadow-cljs watch :workspaces

# ... shadow server at localhost:9630
# ... shadow repl at localhost:9000


# 2.
# Connect via nrepl to localhost:9000
# You are now in the main Shadow CLJS compiler environment. Run `(shadow/repl :workspaces)` and 
# shadow will change the nrepl session to a direct connection to the browser.
```

If you are running IntelliJ, you should see pre-built configurations in the run menu.
