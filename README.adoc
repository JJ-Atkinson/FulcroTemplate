There are 3 parts to get the project up and running for you to see. First, the clj server for the index.html, second,
the Shadow CLJS server, and third, the CLJS repl. Setup for each:


```Shell
npm install


# 1.
clj -A:dev

# user=> (start)
# ... 
# ... Server started at localhost:3000


# 2.  (there are several ways to run this, but I find this easiest)
npx shadow-cljs watch :main

# ... shadow server at localhost:9630
# ... shadow repl at localhost:9000


# 3.
# Connect via nrepl to localhost:9000
# You are now in the main Shadow CLJS compiler environment. Run `(shadow/repl :main)` and 
# shadow will change the nrepl session to a direct connection to the browser.
```

If you are running IntelliJ, you should see pre-built configurations in the run menu.
